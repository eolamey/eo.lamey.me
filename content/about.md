# About

Hi! I'm Eric-Olivier Lamey, and this is my website. Also, I don't like to talk about myself.

## Colophon

Although this website's HTML and CSS were mostly done from scratch, the design is inspired by two themes, [kiss](https://themes.gohugo.io/kiss/) and [ezhill](https://themes.gohugo.io/ezhil/); the resume's design is inspired by [markdown-resume](https://github.com/there4/markdown-resume).

The website generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
