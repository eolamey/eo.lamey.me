## Experience

* __Tech Lead__, Cloudwatt
* Remote, 11/2012 - 12/2017

I joined Cloudwatt, a French public cloud provider, as the company was created to provide storage, network and compute services to local businesses and government entities. I worked with several contractor teams to architect and deploy the system and software stacks for the front-end components, data plane and control plane, based on OpenStack and Contrail.

I owned the bare metal and Linux deployment and packaging infrastructures, the virtualization stack, as well as most configuration management tools, ensuring consistent and efficient operations for hundreds of physical and virtual servers, in multiple environments and data centers.

After more than two years on an operations team, I switched focus to internal development processes and infrastructure, as well as application lifecycle. I designed and implemented new application deployment standards and tooling, with a focus on connecting the existing bare metal and virtual machines with the new container based infrastructure.

I also designed and developed several internal command line tools and APIs, as well as a web dashboard for OpenStack resources.

As the tech lead for Louis Vuitton's e-commerce infrastructure, I participated in the architecture and migration of the main website to a new technical stack. I was the owner of the bare metal provisioning infrastructure and the configuration management tools. I was responsible for automating systems as well as applications, and the overall system architecture to meet Louis Vuitton's SLAs and standards for high availability and scalability.

I worked closely with multiple teams, from developers to project managers for the client, software architects, sysadmins, DBAs, datacenter technicians and network operators, working for several different contractors.
